// Example FizzBuzz function

Create a function that simulates a simple guessing
game. This function should generate a random number between 1 and 10 and then prompt the user to guess the number. Use a do-while loop to keep asking them to guess again until they get it right.
// Note: Since TypeScript runs on Node.js for this task, consider a pseudo-code or describe the logic, as `prompt` is not available in standard Node.js without additional packages.

### 𝐐5 - 𝐖𝐡𝐢𝐥𝐞 𝐋𝐨𝐨𝐩 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐚 𝐂𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐭𝐝𝐨𝐰𝐧
Write a function that takes a number as an argument
and counts down to zero using a while loop, printing each number to the console.
// Example countdown function

### 𝐐6 -  𝐄𝐧𝐮𝐦𝐬 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐃𝐚𝐲𝐬 𝐨𝐟 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐖𝐞𝐞𝐤
Define an enum for days of the week. Write a function that takes a day as an argument and returns "Weekend" if it's Saturday or Sunday, and "Weekday" for other days.
// Example enum for days and function
